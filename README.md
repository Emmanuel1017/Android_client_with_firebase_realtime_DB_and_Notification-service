# 📱 Android Client with Firebase Realtime DB and Notification Service

![App Icon](app_icon.png)

Welcome to our fun and goofy Android app that brings real-time updates from Firebase's Realtime Database right to your device! 🚀

## Features:

- **Real-time Updates:** Get live updates from Firebase's Realtime Database.
- **Custom Notifications:** Receive custom, colorful notifications.
- **Recycle View:** Display updates in a playful RecyclerView.

## Why So Goofy?

We believe in having a little fun while making amazing apps! Our app is all about delivering a smile with every notification. 😄

## Disadvantages of Our Current Approach:

- ⚡️ Power Consumption: Our background listener service consumes some power, but it's not too significant.
- 🔌 Autostart Permission: To run efficiently, you might need to grant the autostart permission and disable battery optimizations.
- 📈 Scaling Limitations: In large-scale production, we can handle up to 100,000 clients at a time due to using "OnChildAdded" listeners in the Realtime DB. We fetch the last child only.

## Future Improvements: Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)

We are planning to upgrade our notification system to use Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for a more efficient and scalable solution. Stay tuned for even more colorful and efficient notifications! 🌈

## Installation:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Configure your Firebase project by adding your `google-services.json` file.
4. Build and run the app on your Android device.

## How to Contribute:
