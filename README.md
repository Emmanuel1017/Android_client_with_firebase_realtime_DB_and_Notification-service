# 📱 Android Client with Firebase Realtime DB and Notification Service

![App Icon](app_icon.png)

Welcome to my open-source Android app designed for learning and fun! 🚀

## Learning and Fun Combined:

This project is all about providing a playground for developers to explore real-time updates from Firebase's Realtime Database, custom notifications, and RecyclerView integration.

## Features:

- **Real-time Updates:** Experience the magic of real-time data with Firebase's Realtime Database.
- **Custom Notifications:** Customize and play with colorful notifications.
- **Recycle View:** Learn how to display data updates in a RecyclerView.

## Disadvantages of My Current Approach:

- ⚡️ Power Consumption: My background listener service consumes some power, but it's not too significant.
- 🔌 Autostart Permission: To run efficiently, you might need to grant the autostart permission and disable battery optimizations.
- 📈 Scaling Limitations: In large-scale production, I can handle up to 100,000 clients at a time due to using "OnChildAdded" listeners in the Realtime
